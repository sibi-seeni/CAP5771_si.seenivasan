### 1. What is the central idea?

Perform sentiment analysis about a newly released major game

### 2. Why is it important in context?

It enables the developers to track whether the bug fixes are working.

### 3. What would 'success' look like?

Success would be a daily report of the "game sentiment" rising or falling.

### 4. What variables are essential?

As it is NLP based, the length of the comment, the severity of the words used, etc can be variables.

### 5. Who will use the results?

The publishers of the game/developers can use this.

### 6. Is this realistic?

Though I have not done that before, I have seen others do similar work, so hopefully yes.
